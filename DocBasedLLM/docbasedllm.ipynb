Epigastric pain is the most common symptom of both ga stric and duodenal \nulcers. It is characterized by a gnawing or burning sensation and occurs after meals —classically, shortly \nafter meals with gastric ulcer and 2 -3 hours afterward with duodenal ulcer.  \n \nPossible manifestations include the following:  \n Dyspeps ia, including belching, bloating, distention, and fatty food intolerance  \n Heartburn  \n Chest discomfort  \n Hematemesis or melena resulting from gastrointestinal bleeding. Melena may be intermittent \nover several days or multiple episodes in a single day.  \n Rarel y, a briskly bleeding ulcer can present as hematochezia.  \n Symptoms consistent with anemia (eg, fatigue, dyspnea) may be present  \n Sudden onset of symptoms may indicate perforation.  \n NSAID -induced gastritis or ulcers may be silent, especially in elderly pati ents.  \n Only 20 -25% of patients with symptoms suggestive of peptic ulceration are found on \ninvestigation to have a peptic ulcer.  \nAlarm features that warrant prompt gastroenterology referral include the following:  \n Bleeding or anemia  \n Early satiety  \n Unexpla ined weight loss  \n Progressive dysphagia or odynophagia  \n Recurrent vomiting  \n Family history of GI cancer  \n \nClinical findings are few and nonspecific and include the following:  \n Epigastric tenderness (usually mild)  \n Right upper quadrant tenderness may suggest  a biliary etiology or, less frequently, PUD.  \n Guaiac -positive stool resulting from occult blood loss  \n Melena resulting from acute or subacute gastrointestinal bleeding  \n Succussion splash resulting from partial or complete gastric outlet obstruction  \n \nTrea tment of non -complicated ulcers  \nFor an isolated episode:  \nIdentify patients taking NSAID or acetylsalicylic acid; stop treatment;  \nEncourage patients to avoid alcohol and tobacco use;  \nOmeprazole : 40 mg PO qDay for 4 -8 weeks  \n \nDuodenal Ulcer  \nOmeprazole : 20 mg PO qDay for 4 -8 weeks  \n \nA special diet is not indicated for patients with duodenal ulcers. It is a common -sense approach to avoid \nany food or beverages that may aggravate symptoms.  \n \nSurgical consultation is recommended for all patients with bleeding ulcers,  especially those patients who \nare at high risk of significant bleeding. Such ulcers include those that have caused hemodynamic \ninstability, those that are actively bleeding.\n22 \n  \nPAIN in ADULTS  \n \n \nA.- TYPES OF PAIN  \nA.1. NOCI CEPTIVE PAIN  \nUsual form of pain, acute or chronic. Nervous system without damage.  \nB.1.1 Somatic pain : Comes from the skin and deep tissues and is easier to locate than visceral pain: \nmusculoskeletal pain, backpain, headache, arthritis.  \nB.2.2 Visceral pa in: Comes from the internal organs. Usually dull and vague, and may be harder to \npinpoint: bladder pain, prostate pain, irritable bowel syndrome, endometriosis, dysmenorrhea, nephritic \ncolic.  \nA.2 NEUROPATHIC PAIN  \nLess frequent. Nerves have damage. Recurr ent acute attacks of pain such as paresthesia or burning, \nusually with dysesthesia.  \nSome forms of pain can be a combination of nociceptive and neuropathic, e.g. some teeth pain.  \nB.- TREATMENT  \nOral forms should be used whenever possible  \nThe combination of different drugs (multimodal analgesia) is adequate (e.g, Paracetamol and NSAIDs; \nParacetamol and codeine)  \nDo not use simultaneously weak and strong opioids  \nThe dosage and duration of treatment are guided by the assessment of type, intensity and locati on of \nthe pain\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, pipeline\nimport torch\nfrom langchain import PromptTemplate\nfrom langchain.llms import HuggingFacePipeline\nfrom langchain.chains.question_answering import load_qa_chain","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-29T18:10:00.326046Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-29T18:10:00.326953Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-29T18:10:03.354207Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-10-29T18:10:00.326916Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-29T18:10:03.353411Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"template = \"\"\"Below is an instruction that describes a task.
