# Deep Learning Frameworks

### We use frameworks because of the following reasons:

- Ease of progarmming (developement and deployment)
- Running speed
- Truly open (open source with good governance)

### The different types of frameworks used are:

- Tensorflow
- Pytorch
- Lasagne
- Keras
- mxnet
- Caffe/Caffe2
- PaddlePaddle, etc.
