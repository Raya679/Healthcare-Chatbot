# Parameters VS Hyperparameters

### The parameters in DL are:

#### W<sup>[1]</sup>,b<sup>[1]</sup>,W<sup>[2]</sup>,b<sup>[2]</sup>,.... so on.

### The hyperparameters in DL are:

#### Learning rate $a$(alpha), iterations, no. of hidden layers 'L', hidden units (n<sup>[1]</sup>,n<sup>[2]</sup>...), choice of activation function, etc.

#### The hyperparameters control the parameters W and b. They help to determine the value of the parameters.

### Logistics Regression

#### In the above two diagrams, a logistics regression or NN is similar to that of a neuron as it takes in various inputs in the form of x1,x2,x3... and gives a single output in the form of 'y'.

#### Similarly in a neuron, it receives signals from its dendrites and passes them through its long body called axon and then transmits them to the next neuron in line.
