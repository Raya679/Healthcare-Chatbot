  what is deep  network??
  earliers layers detect simplrer features 
  further complex functions for detecting complex layers..
  
  
  if there are more hidden layers then less hidden units ie neurons required
  
  hyperparameters : control the parameters and cannot be altered during the processes
  hyperparameters eg:no. of hidden layer
  no. of iterations
  no. of neurons
  learning rate
  
  learning rate alpha should be called a hyper parameer
  
  try out diff values of hyperparameters..to get appropriate output
  
  
  keep updating hyperparameters over a long run to get max efficiency```
